# Middlebury Humanities Data in R Study Group

Welcome! This Study Group is based at Middlebury College, in Middlebury, VT. The facilitators of this group are Ryan Clement, Data Services Librarian, and Kristy Golubiewski-Davis, Digital Liberal Arts CLIR Post Doctoral Fellow. We're excited that you're interested in learning more about data, coding, and reproducible research with us! You can reach us at <rclement@middlebury.edu> or <kgolubiewskidavis@middlebury.edu>.

This Middlebury Study Group is an informal meetup of friends and colleagues to share skills, stories, and ideas on using code for research and exploring open research practices. The goal is to create a friendly, no-pressure environment where people can share their work, ask for help on a coding problem, and learn and work together with their peers.

Our first meetings will start in February 2017, time and location TBD. We will start our study by working through the book [*Humanities Data in R*](http://humanitiesdata.org/) together. This book is available as an ebook [here](http://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-3-319-20702-5) if you are affiliated with Middlebury.

If you're interested in participating, please fill out our [brief survey](https://docs.google.com/a/middlebury.edu/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeYJ1PH1tRrVNviZbTFGkMvp7fA-ARL3mMgoqCM5fusPkVWlw/viewform) to let us know about your interest and your experience level.
